	Methods : 
		
	
	Supported use cases :
		User should be able to turn the key on and start the car.
			Car engine starts when :
				Key is turned on AND (Clutch is pressed (at position 5.0) OR Gear position is Neutral)
			When the key it turned ON, Car Engine starts, fuel starts depleting at a rate of 0.001 lt/sec.
		User should be able to shift to a desired gear after pressing the clutch. // Cannot put reverse gear while speed is > 0;
			Shift Gear :
				Only when clutch is pressed.
					Shift to a new gear and then user can release the clutch.
				Car Max speed = gearPosition * 40;
				Engine RPM = gearPosition * 1200 + 300*accelPosition/(high-low); // Reverse RPM = 1200 ; Neutral RPM = 1200;
				Fuel Burn Rate = 0.002 * gearPosition ; // Reverse Gear - 0.002;
					// Burn rate is 0.002 to 0.005 : 0 acceleration to 5.0 acceleration.
				EngineTemp = 50 + Engine RPM/60;
		User should be able to accelerate the vehicle(car).
			When accelerating : 
				Engine RPM = gearPosition * 1200 + 300*accelPosition/(high-low); // Reverse RPM = 1200 ; Neutral RPM = 1200;
				Fuel Burn Rate = 0.002 * gearPosition ; // Reverse Gear - 0.002;
					// Burn rate is 0.002 to 0.005 : 0 acceleration to 5.0 acceleration.
				EngineTemp = 50 + Engine RPM/60;
				
		user should be able to apply brakes on the vehicle.
			When applying brakes : 
				Apply decceleration to Car's Speed.
		User should be able to get fuel added to the vehicle tank.
			It takes time to refuel the tank - 50 litters/min.
			Fuel quantity cannot be increased beyond tank capacity.
		User should be able to turn on an indicator based on the turn they are taking Right/Left.
			Turn Left/Right lights ON/off based on indicator position.
